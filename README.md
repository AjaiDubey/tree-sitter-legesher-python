### Contributing to Legesher in Python
Generate the updated tree-sitter parser by running the below command:  
`tree-sitter generate`

To make sure that the parse is properly updated, run the tests.  
`tree-sitter test`

This package works alongside the _language_ repository [`language-legesher-python`](https://github.com/legesher/language-legesher-python). These two repositories work closely together, so it may be useful to touch up on both repositories' documentation.
